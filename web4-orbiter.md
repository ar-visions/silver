how we use the internet has evolved with society and its use of media and technology. freedom of annotation on media is fundamental to establishing a true AGI used by the public -- one that is decentralized, domain-rich, and multimodal. it empowers the user rather than replaces them, because we are elevated by what we create together. it cannot replace any one of us, since it is authored by all of us, freely. words, images, videos, and any openly described type are unit members forming the basis for a web4 unit.

web4 is a great index of a collective creation, grounded in the power of git repositories. any public or private host may participate, and there is no central ownership of this idea. users establish their domains as user:project.unit/version. we use our domain when no domain is given, and local-units when no project is given.  this works for any git provider.

these apps are built and rendered in Orbiter, a browser written in Silver, where editing, saving, and rebuilding are natural extensions of interaction. silver provides the foundation for this new form of "checking out" sites; every 'site' being a versioned checkout built from source for target devices.

in this new web4 space, we expand upon technology foundations to empower the user -- to become the collective soul of the machine. applications are described through media annotations: words, sound, images, and video as unified members of intelligent units. each unit becomes a neuron in a larger network, a visible trace of human intelligence recorded in open data and executable form. AGI, then, is not a corporate artifact but a living creation of us all. it is the network that learns from and with us, guided by clarity, creativity, and the shared intent to build machines that directly reflect their users.
