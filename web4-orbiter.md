For Michael

The idea of what to do with the internet has evolved with society and its use of media.  I realize that freedom of annotation on media is a basic token to establish a true AGI we all use.  Effectively its the network it consumes, and the network that builds upon itself. This is our true reflection, and it's empowering -- not replacing at all.  It cannot replace any one of us, since its authored by us all for free.

words, images, videos, any openly described type.  these are members of units desribed in a unit.

we're peer-to-peer in this great index, because we have a wide variety of git repository services.  again, this is any network we host or reference, it need not be any specific corporate ownership. as a default, github does not alter its users data and abides by reasonable law -- this is a decent foundation for name and view.  you can even submit bugs and work together to improve things both in public and private.

users are their own domains, with a separator for user:project.unit[ version ] or app-indexed defaults for user:project

this space is given unlimited free dimensions to extent to as many as there are git hosted domains we may trust publicly or private.  anybody can make one, even for private enterprise.  these apps when built and rendered will be done so in a browser called Orbiter.

to edit, we may alter our checked out source and watch for changes in source and rebuild in browser.  to revert, we use git, and to commit changes we also use git.  git is powerful in that it knows its remote url origin, so the directory is aware of its own identity.

silver is the programming language we write Orbiter in -- its a language we use as a basis for building these apps that run in this new form of browsing by building.  when we say we are checking out a site, it will quite literally mean that.  the device scope is limitless: this means different capabilities from alarm clock to ear-piece to AR glasses or currently most impactful in composition ability: AI desktop.

listening to changes in units which constitutes an entire app src, or data.  it depends on who is translating. in one way. it's a basic schema to share app compositions with each other.

an app imports a web4 uri

for things to run, they must have their entire source media, auditable across all git commits. its native apps and its indexed media -- it's an ability to run tailored domain apps and services -- its more secure than what we do now and more maintainable in unit forms.

it's definitely web4 if identifiable easier than current, and without cost.

that is, our take on any media. A source file is media -- or a video, etc. we run it in a browser called Orbiter that switches to edit the annotation while browsing the universe for others

In app, it has an orbital-view above different planets with Earth and its oceans and morphing sky being the primary focus.  Apps render transparent, frosted and opaque views on top of this.  Its background render will adjust with your head in space on the AI desktop.

I believe with a web4, we expanding upon the foundations of technology to empower the user -- this, so we can be the 'collective soul' of the machine.  we describe methods in media of words, audio, image and video all in module membership.  this to me is a 'silver' module, and its the basic annotation unit, a module which may be an app that outputs data.

These are composed apps we describe and augment through media annotations. Think of this as a unit of intelligence, the neuron breadcrumbs we place in any domain that let people train for our intelligence as far as the data and compute allow it to reach, in all open devices.

AGI is us. It's not some company saying they got it. We define who we are. It's not actually not difficult a thing, and in time this will be what we call web4 space that relies on its open data to scale the AI progress curve -- one that promotes intelligent use, clarity, as well as clear human guidance for machines.
