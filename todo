[-] watcher for silver
    [x] re-create Module-Ref and 'rebuild' however we do not need to reimport!
        [x] store imports by name in memory
    [-] untested so far 
    [ ] find all memory leaks (there most definitely are!)
        > profile resources in LLVM if possible

[-] finish integration of map
    > give meta args to allocator (update some uses of LLVMBuildMalloc to our own A-type methods in .c)
    some syntax needs verification (workflow item tonight: A)

[ ] finish integration of array
    also some syntax needs verification (workflow item tonight: B)

[??] formatter logic
    > %s will perform string cast, then cstr cast for object types (if they give a cstr, no conversion!)
    > %i returns i32 cast
    > %ull returns u64 cast
    > %ll returns i64 cast
    > %f, d, etc
    [x] implemented {expression to string} syntax; its certainly possible to use printf as well, and those functions are made more secure with only ability to give literal "constant, read-only strings with %f inside"
[ ] guard functions need only register an instance of this, created anew when the incoming is null
    > this is to mimick the -> guard in member access (same token ->)

[-] verify object allocation into c, it must use Au for this
    > no actual allocations done in silver with BuildMAlloc

[x] e_fn_call needs to perform runtime polymorphism (reading from table  by type's schema_f)
    > support method calls on primitives

[x] statements
    [x] while
    [x] if
    [x] ifdef
    [x] for
    [x] loop [ this is loop-while or just loop ]
        [x] loop-while

[ ] fix and finish chatgpt implementation
    [x] requires more net testing, get all functions working
    [ ] regenerate based on hash value from dictation given
        - if different hash, or no .ai file we regenerate
        - its important to note this format ONLY contains the method,
          and is itself not a stand-alone silver module

[ ] progress testing coverage to entire test.ag module
    [ ] uncomment entire file
    [ ] implement the import logic to require no other statements other than import prior
    [ ] retest ifdef

[x] Au model/member reduction into Au_t (after: reduction, ha!)
    [x] register types modules, with default being an exported symbol au, in struct _Au_t
    *** everything is mappable -- with default being a linked-list
        maps are something you request by api and thus we can lazy-load.  we can do this
        easier when we have meta types associated to our use-case members (desc by the user)
    [x] convert creation and management of model/struct/class/enumeration

[ ] orbiter experience for the user:
    - we talk to the editor, and it scrolls-to where we want.
    - ideally we dont have to take our hands off the keyboard for this.
    - perform this on a transition (to orbit your project, etc)


[ ] build in line incrementing debug info for functions; so we break at function:5 iteration
    [ ] must-have 0.88 feature
