[-] watcher for silver
    [x] re-create Module-Ref and 'rebuild' however we do not need to reimport!
        [x] store imports by name in memory
    [-] untested so far 
    [ ] find all memory leaks (there most definitely are!)

[ ] finish integration of map
    > give meta args to allocator (update some uses of LLVMBuildMalloc to our own A-type methods in .c)

[ ] finish integration of array

[ ] use Au in all cases, no reproducing results when we may call.  implementation must be kept to a minimum, and in .c
    > we are producing the header directly from reflection of Au, so this 'is' Au
    > this so far is uncompiled and must be completed:
        [ ] init macros must be generated (methods are)
        [x] method macros
        [x] class declarations
        [x] class construction done in silver.o, not .c (there will be no define_class(cl, meta, meta2))

[ ] generate A-type header file when it is not there for .c files (stem name, no extension)

[ ] formatter logic
    > %s will perform string cast, then cstr cast for object types (if they give a cstr, no conversion!)
    > %i returns i32 cast
    > %ull returns u64 cast
    > %ll returns i64 cast
    > %f, d, etc

[ ] guard functions need only register an instance of this, created anew when the incoming is null
    > this is to mimick the -> guard in member access (same token ->)

[-] verify object allocation into c, it must use Au for this
    > no actual allocations done in silver with BuildMAlloc
