about Kalen Novis White:

i am an open-data person.  i believe it's our God given right to contribute together in public and private.

i believe AGI is us.  it's Aggregated Group Intelligence. collectively and cooperatively, we offer a superior model to proprietary, some-what metered in contract models; ones that cannot enumerable public IP usage properly. alternatively with AGI, we summarize fair usage across IP identities (G), provably -- a more eco-profitable model that the public owns collectively, integrated to the level of authorship ability in the devices we use.

using AGI in real time, we can actually query-upon collective committed media in the open.  it's fascinating to consider what our collective can achieve together, and how much we can intellectually and emotionally progress with great applications of it.

rather than let corporations define the model, we do and they adopt for more profit and less infrastructure needed on their part -- they focus on their great products and add us along to annotate using the devices they create.  in short, thats us driving a car to help annotate self-drive.

this publicly committed approach is more-provable for IP than closed systems, especially when we all write the very operating systems they run on, and have verifiable barriers between public and private data.

i think this is the only way that IP law can work in an AI age.  nobody can prove weights-only, private-corporate models in court.  the training must be open for proof; auto-payment could depend on summary queries alone, which you make as another model that is directly correlated, they need not run on small systems for the summary which is far more vast.  so, embedded ultra-edge-case covered, along with towering cloud servers to compute larger summaries of groups.

we commit to our own annotations on absolutely anything we want.  we commit public when we desire to do so.  this is a giant decentralized media index with running apps in the nodes.

this process of media composition will become easier, more intuitive over time with desktop eye-tracking AIs we can converse with for 'public' screen elements.  you use your hands and eyes as cursors in the machine.  we are the next device to exist inside our machines, like a kind of collective tron but without wearing any gear.  for presentation, the desktop screen may counter-distort its view with an ability to see things from different angles -- like a virtual hologram using a 2D parallax technique applied in shaders.  thats probably my focus, is composer agent.  thats Orbiter, and it lets you run web4 apps with an ability to edit the source if its available.  its being written in silver, a native and more reflective  language with memory-refs on public and private module members.  it's different enough from most languages to really be there.  it imports git urls for software, building directly without moderated package management.

we seem to be purpose built agents in the domains we love to work and play in.  together, we commit our best methods using nothing but spoken language in our operating system of choice.
