# **silver** lang
development in progress, with documentation to be added/changed.

Update: context addition to release 88:
### Context-Aware Members

In silver we describe members that implicitly **pull from context** without requiring explicit passing by user, unless with intent.
Inherently required arguments, context represents a second level of public member, one that is implicit and allows for syntax reduction

If the context is not available and the user does not specify it, the compiler will require them to either provide it.  Passing null for an object is following that rule.

This enables a natural, readable flow for code with less boilerplate.  When the user does describe syntax, it is with clearer intention.

```python

linux ?? import [ https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols 810f1adaf33521cc55fc510566efba2a1418174f ]

import <vulkan/vulkan.h> [ https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers main ]

# token operations require design-time ready variables -- these are NOT enodes.
# its decidedly not mode-oriented for this syntax
# so it's clear to understand!

import [ https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tools main ]
	-DVULKAN_HEADERS_INSTALL_DIR={install}
	{linux ?? -DWAYLAND_PROTOCOLS_DIR={install}/checkout/wayland-protocols}

version = '22'

# no one can override these, but :'s can be when importing; this can change what gets imported, how its built, etc.
# this demonstrates language control over more than is typical from a module interface
# silver is a build language first, and one that treats git as first class

# **import** keyword
**silver** starts with **import**. The **import** keyword lets you build and include from projects in any language, with coupled configuration parameters and <comma, separated> includes.  Local source links are prioritized before external checkouts, so you can build externals locally with your own changes.  This is a far better way to collaborate in open source with yourself and others. Silver simply gets out of the way when it comes to git for your own source; it's merely importing.  The build process will recognize the various environment variables such as **CC**, **CXX**, **RUSTC**, **CPP**

As a language, **silver** is fewer moving syntactic parts (no direct requirement of Make, CMake for your projects).  It's fewer tokens, first class methods, and a strong stance against centralized package management.  It's considered a build language first, and tries to do the works after, by facilitating native build targets through standard compilation toolchain LLVM.  In watch mode (or development mode), changes are built immediately, with large C headers kept in memory for faster updates. **silver** is the language target for the Orbiter IDE, which is currently in development.

# **A-type** foundation
A-type is the foundation of **silver**'s compiler and reflection system. It provides compatibility and reflection capabilities that enable dynamic behavior and runtime type inspection. With A-type, you can write classes in C and seamlessly use them in **silver**, similar to Python's extension protocol. A-type makes **silver** adaptable and extensible, integrating deeply with both the language and its C interoperability features.
