# **silver** lang
development in progress, with documentation to be added/changed.

Update: context addition to release 88:
### Context-Aware Members

In silver we describe members that implicitly **pull from a context** without requiring explicit passing every time. If the context is not available and the user does not specify it, the compiler will require them to either provide it or explicitly set it to `null`. This enables a natural, readable flow for code, where dependencies are declared as part of the structure itselfâ€”no boilerplate, no magic, and no hidden state.

```silver
main test_vulkan
    public  queue_family_index : i32[ 2 ], string i64 i32
    intern  an_intern_member   : i64[ 4 ]
    context a-context-member
```

# **import** keyword
**silver** starts with **import**. The **import** keyword lets you build and include from projects in any language, with coupled configuration parameters and <comma, separated> includes.  Local source links are prioritized before external checkouts, so you can build externals locally with your own changes.  This is a far better way to collaborate in open source with yourself and others. Silver simply gets out of the way when it comes to git for your own source; it's merely importing.  The build process will recognize the various environment variables such as **CC**, **CXX**, **RUSTC**, **CPP**

As a language, **silver** is fewer moving syntactic parts (no direct requirement of Make, CMake for your projects).  It's fewer tokens, first class methods, and a strong stance against centralized package management.  It's considered a build language first, and tries to do the works after, by facilitating native build targets through standard compilation toolchain LLVM.  In watch mode (or development mode), changes are built immediately, with large C headers kept in memory for faster updates. **silver** is the language target for the Orbiter IDE, which is currently in development.

# **A-type** foundation
A-type is the foundation of **silver**'s compiler and reflection system. It provides compatibility and reflection capabilities that enable dynamic behavior and runtime type inspection. With A-type, you can write classes in C and seamlessly use them in **silver**, similar to Python's extension protocol. A-type makes **silver** adaptable and extensible, integrating deeply with both the language and its C interoperability features.
