# AGI Vision

I believe **AGI is us**. AGI, as I understand it, is **Aggregated Group Intelligence** — decentralized data aggregated from truly identified sources, backed by cryptographic certification.  

Collectively and cooperatively, we offer a superior model to proprietary, somewhat metered contract models; ones that cannot enumerate public IP usage properly. With a proper AGI from the public, we summarize fair usage across IP identities (G) *provably* — a more eco-profitable model in which the public owns collectively. Throughout, we will see this integrated to the level of authorship ability in all devices we use. It’s more free for the user, yet a far more profitable model for corporations to adopt when making products.

When corporations adapt their data to our own public modeling and train with integrity, the products are made more profitable, with less cost on development and meeting cultural requirements across borders. Society effectively boot-straps startups in an open AGI. This enables all organizations to focus on great products while including the world to annotate using the very devices themselves.

One example of this: imagine a person manually driving a car to help annotate self-driving.

**Adopting open-data is the only way IP law can operate in an AI age.** The training must be open for proof, with identifiable sources for IP origin. The 'G' in AGI is our group identifier -- it is ourselves or the group we participate in.  Identity itself is a real basis for summation.

AGI is not a 'God-like' super formula we find -- it's in history and all of its annotations made over time.

It's adaptive by nature, because that is our nature. You cannot replace the human being in any form of AI models, especially not one that operates entirely from human beings.
